This is Haiwei LIN (カイイ リン). Currently, I am a Ph.D. student at the Graduate School of Informatics, Chiba University. My research focuses on visual privacy protection, exploring methods to generate visually uninformative images / videos that remain recognizable to AI models. These works are supported by [JST BOOST](https://www.jst.go.jp/jisedai/boost-s/en/about/index.html).
